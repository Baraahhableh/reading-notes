## CONRTOLLING SIZES OF IMAGES IN CSS

- You can control the size of an 
image using the width and 
height properties in CSS, just 
like you can for any other box. 


- Specifying image sizes helps 
pages to load more smoothly 
because the HTML and CSS 
code will often load before the 
images, and telling the browser 
how much space to leave for an 
image allows it to render the rest 
of the page without waiting for 
the image to download.

## ALIGHNING IMAGES USING CSS

- Rather than using the <img>
element's align attribute, web 
page authors are increasingly 
using the float property to align 
images. There are two ways that 
this is commonly achieved:

1. The float property is added 
to the class that was created to 
represent the size of the image 
(such as the small class in our 
example).

2. New classes are created with 
names such as align-left or 
align-right to align the images 
to the left or right of the page. 
These class names are used in 
addition to classes that indicate 
the size of the image.

### Background Images
background-image

-The background-image
property allows you to place 
an image behind any HTML 
element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By 
default, a background image will 
repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows 
the letters url, and it is put 
inside parentheses and quotes.

### Repeating Images
background-repeat
background-attachment


- The background-repeat
property can have four values:
1. repeat
The background image is 
repeated both horizontally and 
vertically (the default way it 
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
2. repeat-x
The image is repeated 
horizontally only (as shown in 
the first example on the left).
3. repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically 
only.
4. no-repeat
The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment 
property specifies whether a 
background image should stay in 
one position or move as the user 
scrolls up and down the page. It 
can have one of two values:
5. fixed
The background image stays in 
the same position on the page.
6. scroll
The background image moves 
up and down as the user scrolls 
up and down the page.


### CSS3: GRADIENTS 
BACKGROUND-IMAGE

- Some browsers allow you 
to specify the angle of the 
gradient, or even different types 
of gradients (such as radial 
gradients), but support is not 
as widespread as that for linear 
gradients.

## Search Engine 
Optimization (SEO)

- At the heart of SEO is the idea of 
working out which terms people 
are likely to enter into a search 
engine to find your site and then 
using these terms in the right 
places on your site to increase 
the chances that search engines 
will show a link to your site in 
their results.

- On-Page Techniques
On-page techniques are the 
methods you can use on your 
web pages to improve their 
rating in search engines.

- Off-Page Techniques
Getting other sites to link to you 
is just as important as on-page 
techniques. Search engines help 
determine how to rank your 
site by looking at the number of 
other sites that link to yours.

### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases

1. Brainstorm
List down the words that 
someone might type into 
Google to find your site. Be sure 
to include the various topics, 
products or services your site is 
about.

2. Organize
Group the keywords into 
separate lists for the different 
sections or categories of your 
website

3. Research
There are several tools that let 
you enter your keywords and 
then they will suggest additional 
keywords you might like to 
consider, such as:
adwords.google.co.uk/
select/KeywordToolExternal
(When using this tool, select the 
"exact match" option rather than 
"broad match.")

4. Compare
It is very unlikely that your 
site will appear at the top of 
the search results for every 
keyword.

5. Refine
Now you need to pick which 
keywords you will focus on. 
These should always be the ones 
that are most relevant to each 
section of your site.

6. Map
Now that you have a refined list 
of keywords, you know which 
have the most competition, and 
which ones are most relevant, 
it is time to start picking which 
keywords you will use for each 
page.

### What Are Your Visitors Looking At?

- The content link on the left-hand side allows 
you to learn more about what the visitors are 
looking at when they come to your site.

### Domain Names& Hosting


In order to put your site on the web you will 
need a domain name and web hosting.

- DOMAIN NAMES WEB HOSTING
Your domain name is your web 
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites 
that allow you to register domain 
names. Usually you will have to 
pay an annual fee to keep that 
domain name.

- WEB HOSTING
So that other people can see 
your site, you will need to upload 
it to a web server. Web servers 
are special computers that are 
constantly connected to the 
Internet. They are specially set 
up to serve web pages when 
they are requested.

### FTP & Third Party Tools

As the name suggests, File 
Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows 
you to transfer files across the 
Internet from your computer to 
the web server hosting your site. 
There are many FTP programs 
that offer a simple interface 
that shows you the files on your 
computer alongside the files that 
are on your web server. These 
allow you to drag and drop 
files from your computer to the 
server or vice versa.
