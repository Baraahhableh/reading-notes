# ***What is GIT ?***

it is a software used locally on the system without the need of internet connection. It is used to track files or the changes that is already done on the files.

## *Local Operations*

Git almost depend on local operations that contain all the necessary information. This enables process speed, since the history of a project exists on the local disk.


## *Tracking Changes*

Git tracks every single modification that is applied to any file or directory. And Git always finds file damage or information loss in transit as the gatekeeper.

### *Loss of Data*
To reduce permanent loss, such as accidently deleted data, Git is created. For a snapshot of your file, Git makes it exceedingly tough to lose.
